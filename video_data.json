We'd warn them stop sending poisons into our country. Any direct contact stands out because the U.S. this week designated Maduro the head of a foreign terrorist organization and led three months of deadly strikes at sea. Bombing vessels, the administration says, transport illegal drugs, more than 80 killed. Now President Trump is ramping up his threat. And we'll be starting to stop him by land also. The land is easier, but that's going to start very soon. This week, Maduro engaged in his own saber rattling. However, theatrical, he also met with his military, pledging to defend every inch of Venezuela. Tuesday, the president told reporters he might talk to Maduro, but did not indicate any call had already happened. We can save lives, we can do things the easy way that's fine, and we have to do it in the heart where that's fine too. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Higgseth visited the U.S. as Gerald Ford in the Caribbean and stopped in the Dominican Republic amid the U.S. buildup. In waging this war on Narco-Terris, we're willing to go on the offense. Go on the offense in a way that changes the dynamic for the entire region. Kelly is traveling with the president in West Palm Beach and is joining us live tonight. And Kelly, any escalation with Venezuela could mean some new criticism for the president from lawmakers on Capitol Hill. We've already seen Democrats and a few Republicans who have questioned the legal justification for the Trump administration's operations in the Caribbean. Congress typically must authorize military action in another country. The administration has defended its operation so far, citing national security to introduce the drug flow. Haley?
